Need to define what is falling from the top of screen.
	How many will fall?
	What's the speed?
	mess around with size to get one you like
What will happen when the egg hits the bottom?



class Egg(simpleGE.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, scene):
        super().__init__(scene)
        self.setImage("Egg.png")
        self.setSize(35,25)
        self.minSpeed = 3
        self.maxSpeed = 8
        self.reset()
        
    def reset(self):
        #move it to the top
        self.y = 10
        
        #x is random 0 - scrren width
        self.x = random.randint(0, self.screenWidth)
        
        #dy is random minSpeed to maxSpeed
        self.dy = random.randint(self.minSpeed, self.maxSpeed)
        
    def checkBounds(self):
        if self.bottom > self.screenHeight:
            self.reset()


What will catch the eggs
	what sound will play when the eggs are caught
	need to move the sprite that catches eggs
	need to set the character sprite
	Sprite position and how fast it moves
	

        
class Duck(simpleGE.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, scene):
        super().__init__(scene)

Games basic run process
	
	Need to set background
	pull sounds for collision
	set number of eggs falling

Need to have an instruction page
	Instructions will have an intro statement to tell about the game and what to do
	Need to have a button to start game and quit game
	Return to Instruction Page after time runs out
	
	BB-	Show a High Score
		Save a High Score
		Load a High Score
